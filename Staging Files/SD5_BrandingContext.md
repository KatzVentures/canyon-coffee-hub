## Language Patterns

**Dashboard metrics:** Direct, numerical, production-oriented
- "480 lbs to roast today" not "You have a busy day ahead!"
- "2 origins below 2-week supply" not "Some inventory is getting low"
- "$92,400 MTD" not "Revenue is tracking well"

**Alerts:** Clear, specific, actionable
- "Ethiopia Yirgacheffe: 3 bags remaining (2-week supply)" not "Low inventory alert"
- "CS-2025-042: Quality complaint — Woodlands Hotel, House Blend" not "New issue reported"
- "Summit Conference Center handoff pending — first delivery Feb 15" not "Action needed"

**Status labels:** Simple, direct
- "Scheduled" / "Roasting" / "Resting" / "Approved" / "Bagged"
- "Active" / "At Risk" / "Churned"
- "Reported" / "Investigating" / "Escalated to Ben" / "Resolved"

## Terminology (Use THEIR words)

From the client record — use these exact terms:
- "Roast schedule" (not "production plan")
- "Standing order" (not "recurring order")
- "Green coffee" (not "raw beans" or "unroasted coffee")
- "Resting" (not "degassing" — even though it's the same thing)
- "Cupping score" (not "quality score")
- "Origin" (not "source" — when referring to green coffee)
- "Handoff" (not "transition" or "transfer" — sales to production)
- "Pipeline" (not "funnel" — Tanya's word)
- "Flagged" (not "failed" — for batches that need investigation)
- "Shrinkage" or "waste" (not "loss" — for roasting weight difference)
- "Route" (not "delivery run")
- "Account" (not "client" or "customer" — for wholesale)
- "Pounds" (not "lbs" in display — spell out for readability, use lbs in compact spaces)
